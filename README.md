# ✍️ Excalidrawings: icons 🎨

A collection of hand-drawn icons of many software services and tools to be used in sketches made with Excalidraw.

## Excalidraw

According to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com):

> Excalidraw is a virtual collaborative whiteboard tool that lets you easily sketch diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them.

And that says it all! `Excalidraw` is an awesome tool to create sketches and drawings! Moreover, it can also be used on software projects as a tool to draw software architectures and solutions.

## A collection of "hand-drawn" icons

Being an excellent sketching software, `Excalidraw` can be used to sketch software projects architectures. However, having to redraw or sketch some famous software icons and logos can be
quite challenging and time-consuming! As a consequence, this repo is an attempt to centralize some hand-drawn icons from many software service providers such as `AWS`, `Microsoft Azure`, `Google Cloud Platform`, etc. so that these icons can be quickly used/reused on new sketches!

## Disclaimer

I do not own any of these logos or icons as they belong to their respective software providers such as (`AWS`, `Google Cloud Platform`, `Microsoft Azure`, etc.). Here I provide some representations of these logos so that they can be reused on sketches made with `Excalidraw`.
