# ✏️ excalidrawings-icons ✏️

A collection of icon drawings of many software and service providers made with Excalidraw.

## Excalidraw

According to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com):

> Excalidraw is a virtual collaborative whiteboard tool that lets you easily sketch diagrams that have a hand-drawn feel to them.

And that says it all! `Excalidraw` is an awesome tool to create sketches and drawings! Moreover, it can also be used on software projects as a tool to design software architectures!

## A collection of "hand-drawn" icons

Being an excellent sketching software, Excalidraw can be used to sketch software projects architectures. However, having to redraw or sketch some famous software icons and logos can be
quite challenging and time-consuming! This repo is an attempt to centralize some hand-drawn icons from many software service providers such as `AWS`, `Microsoft Azure`, `Google Cloud Platform`, etc. so that these icons can be quickly used/reused on new sketches!

## Disclaimer

I do not own any of these logos or icons as they belong to their respective software providers such as (`AWS`, `Google Cloud Platform`, `Microsoft Azure`, etc.). Here I provide some representations of these logos so that they can be reused on sketches made with `Excalidraw`.
